## üöÄ Key Features

The toolkit is organized into six main tools and several creative "Easter Egg" features.

### üé® 1. Color Picker
A robust tool for selecting and converting colors.
- **Native Color Picker:** A standard `<input type="color">` for visual selection.
- **Code Conversions:** Instantly see the selected color in **HEX**, **RGB**, and **HSL** formats.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy any color code format with a single click.
- **Random Color:** Generate a random color to spark inspiration.
- **Cross-Tool Integration:** A dedicated button sends the selected color to the other tools for immediate use.

### üåà 2. Gradient Generator
Create beautiful, custom CSS gradients with a live preview.
- **Gradient Types:** Choose between **Linear** and **Radial** gradients.
- **Angle Control:** Set the precise angle for linear gradients.
- **Dynamic Color Stops:** Add, remove, and change multiple color stops. Adjust their position on the gradient with a slider.
- **Live Preview:** See your gradient update in real-time as you make changes.
- **CSS Output:** Get the complete, ready-to-use CSS code for your gradient.

### üß™ 3. Color Mixer
Blend two colors together to find the perfect shade in between.
- **Dual Color Inputs:** Select two colors to mix.
- **Mixing Ratio Slider:** Control the percentage of each color in the final mix for precise blending.
- **Live Result:** The mixed color is displayed instantly with its HEX code.

### üé® 4. Color Palette Generator
Generate harmonious color schemes based on color theory.
- **Base Color Selection:** Pick a starting color.
- **Harmony Rules:** Automatically generate palettes based on standard rules:
  - **Complementary**
  - **Analogous**
  - **Triadic**
  - **Split-Complementary**
  - **Monochromatic**
- **Interactive Swatches:** The generated palette is displayed as interactive swatches. Clicking a swatch sends its color to the main Color Picker.

### üñ•Ô∏è 5. Page Background Customizer
Instantly test colors and gradients on the page background.
- **Apply Solid Color:** Use the color from the picker to change the page background.
- **Apply Gradient:** Apply the gradient you created in the generator.

### ‚ôø 6. Accessibility Contrast Checker
Ensure your color choices are readable and accessible according to WCAG standards.
- **Foreground & Background Inputs:** Select a text color and a background color.
- **Live Preview:** See how the text looks on the background.
- **Contrast Ratio:** Calculates and displays the contrast ratio in real-time.
- **WCAG Ratings:** Instantly tells you if your color combination passes **AA** and **AAA** standards for normal text.

### ü•ö Creative Features & Easter Eggs
- **Dynamic Light/Dark Mode:** A sleek toggle to switch between a light and dark theme, with preferences saved to local storage.
- **Secret Info Section:** Click the main page title 7 times to reveal a hidden section with fun facts about color theory.
- **Konami Code Disco Mode:** Enter the classic Konami Code (`‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A`) to trigger a wild, color-changing "disco mode" for the page background.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built from the ground up using only core web technologies.
- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Advanced styling, including CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for theming, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.
